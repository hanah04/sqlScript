1. Check your inventory data for unbalances.
 *Run script [check for inventory unbalances]

2. Run scripts for missing items in deliveries, stock issuances & item charges by inserting them to iwitemLedger and iwitemLedgerdaily.
 *change rendate value for item charges to capture all missing charges since beginning.

3. Update your iwitemLedgerDaily & iwWareitem tables.
 *Run script [update iwitemLedgerDaily & update iwWareitem]
 *Or you can just run the MMS Validation(Updating) Tool

4. When your done correcting all inventory balance inconsistencies, there might still instances wherein item charges will not commit to tables. 
Therefore you need to schedule a SQL JOB for this event. These scripts must be in chronological order. Time schedule will be on client's discretion. 
Example, once a day, twice a day, etc. Take note that this is a sql job and might consume server resources. 
Therefore we suggest, schedule the sql job during off-peak hours. 
(This is only for item charges since based on the recent R25 releases, deliveries and stock issuances are now working properly.)
*Look scripts in chronological order in folder SQL JOBS for missing item charged.

5. End.
